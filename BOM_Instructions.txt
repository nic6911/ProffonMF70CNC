HowTo:
Print the parts
Measure up lengths of wires for motors and switches (make them somewhat longer than needed to be sure) and solder things up to get the extended cabling needed
Disassemble the x, y and z-axis of the proxxon
Remove the xyz handles from the lead screws
F5-12M bearings goes in both ends on the x and y-axes and on the z-axis it there is one on both sides of the printed z-axis mount
Only the original proxxon plastic part on the motor side is replaced on the x and y-axes
A grooving in the 3D printed parts for the x and y-axes takes the metal plate from the original proxxon part
Mount motors and end-switches on the x and y-axes motor mounts
When a bearing has been placed in both ends of the x and y-axes the the motor mounts can be added to the x and y-axes (remember spacer and flex coupling)
Make sure there is a little tension on the flex-coupler up against the spacer that pushes on the F5-12M bearing
